Introduction
------------

FRET is a framework for the elicitation, specification, formalization, and analysis of system requirements. It enables users to specify unambiguous requirements using restricted English sentences while providing multiple representations to enhance clarity and validation of semantics. These representations include natural language descriptions, formal mathematical logics, and visual diagrams, allowing users with different expertise to review and understand the precise meaning of each requirement.

FRET supports hierarchical requirement definition, enabling users to organize requirements based on different levels. It also offers export capabilities in various formats, facilitating integration with external formal analysis tools. FRET provides automated, requirement-based test case generation, incorporating a coverage metric to assess the adequacy of generated tests. Furthermore, FRET includes built-in consistency checking mechanisms to detect conflicts between requirements and thus, it helps to ensure that requirements are complete and correct.

For more details, refer to the [FRET manual](fret-electron/docs/_media/userManual.md).
