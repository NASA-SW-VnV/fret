FRET: Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool
=============================================

Introduction
------------

FRET is a framework for the elicitation, specification, formalization and understanding of requirements. Users enter system requirements in a specialized natural language. FRET helps understanding and review of semantics by utilizing a variety of forms for each requirement: natural language description, formal mathematical logics, and diagrams. Requirements can be defined in a hierarchical fashion and can be exported in a variety of forms to be used by analysis tools.
