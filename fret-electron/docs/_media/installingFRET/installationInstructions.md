### Install and Run

When you open the FRET distribution, you will see the following directory structure:

```
.
├── fret-electron
├── tools
├── caseStudies
├── CONTRIBUTORS.md
├── LICENSE.pdf
└── README.md
```

* Here are the steps to install and run FRET on Linux and MacOS systems:

  1. cd fret-electron
  2. npm run fret-install (please do 'npm run fret-reinstall' instead if you already have a FRET installation)
  3. npm start


* Alternatively, for MacOS or Linux users, we provide means to build an executable natively or through Docker. See [Building executables](buildingExecutables.md).

* For the installation of FRET on Windows see our [Windows installation guide](installation_windows.md).

* If you run into installation issues, check the [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md) section.

* FRET developers, check the [Developer's guide](../developersGuide/installingAndRunningFRET.md).

### Notes

> __Note:__ To run the LTLSIM simulator, a NuSMV (see http://nusmv.fbk.eu/) installation is required. Please make sure that the NuSMV binaries directory is added to the PATH environment variable. Additionally, please add `$PATH_TO_FRET/fret/tools/LTLSIM/ltlsim-core/simulator` to the PATH environment variable. Note that $PATH_TO_FRET  is the path location where the FRET git repo was cloned (and not the path to the FRET binary).

> __Note:__ To perform realizability checking, additional dependencies must be installed. Read the realizability checking [Dependencies](../exports/realizabilityManual.md) section for details.

> __Note:__ You can config FRET to specify which version of python to use. For example, to use python3 executable, run the following: `npm config set python /usr/bin/python3.x`
