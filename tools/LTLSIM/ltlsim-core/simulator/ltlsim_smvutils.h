/** \brief Analyze a single formula or the entire ltlsim model.
 * 
 * This function can be called to analyze a single formula or all formulas of the specified ltlsim model. 
 * To analyze all formulas, an index of -1 must be specified. 
 *  - If only a single formula is evaluated, a file
 * `<id>.smv` is created in the `./tmp/` directory, which contains the smv translation of the traces specified 
 * by the models atomics and LTL specifications corresponding to the formula. If the `doTrace` flag is false,
 * this is only a single specification of the form `LTLSPEC NAME <id> := <expr>`, where `<id>` is the formulas id
 * and `<expr>` is the formulas expression. Otherwise `n` additional specifications of the form 
 * `LTLSPEC NAME <id>_t<i> := G ((t = <i>) -> (<expr>)` are created, where `n` is the trace length of the model and
 * `<i>` is a running time index (i.e. `0 <= <i> < n`).
 *  - If all formulas are evaluated, a single file `tmp.smv` is created in the `./tmp/` directory, which contains the
 * smv translation for the traces and all formulas of the model.
 * 
 * \param m A pointer to the ltlsim model.
 * \param idx The index of the formula to be analyzed in the ltlsim model formulas collection.
 * \param doTrace A flag indicating whether time traces should be computed, or the formula should only be evaluated globally.
 * \returns Exit status of the analysis. In the case of an error -1 is returned, otherwise 0 is returned.
